sidebar_label: Overview

The GraspOS API specification is designed to facilitate data exchange and interoperability between onboarded metadata sources and value-added services. 
Built upon an extension of the Scientific Knowledge Graph Interoperability Framework (SKG-IF), 
this specification introduces additional concepts tailored for research assessment applications, such as indicators and narratives.


At this stage, the GraspOS API specification includes essential functionality
enabling metadata retrieval in compliance with the SKG-IF framework,
while a fully-featured API remains a longer-term goal.

#### Core Endpoints

GraspOS will support APIs modeled on the guidelines provided in the [SKG-IF specification](https://skg-if.github.io/api/). Users are encouraged to refer to the SKG-IF API Documentation for detailed descriptions of core endpoints and their expected functionality.

GraspOS will align with these specification, including endpoints for:

* Listing supported identifier schemes.
* Resolving individual identifiers within specified schemes.
* Batch resolution of multiple identifier pairs.

These endpoints will enable seamless interaction with GraspOS services while maintaining compatibility with the broader SKG-IF ecosystem.

#### Extensibility and Future Work

The current specification supports foundational data exchange requirements, with room for extensions to accommodate additional parameters or functionalities. As GraspOS evolves, further discussions within project's working groups will explore the feasibility of developing a more comprehensive API specification to address advanced interoperability needs.
