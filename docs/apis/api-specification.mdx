The **GraspOS API specification** is designed to facilitate data exchange and interoperability between onboarded metadata sources and value-added services.  

Built upon the **[RA-SKG extension](https://skg-if.github.io/ext-ra-skg/)** of the [**Scientific Knowledge Graphs Interoperability Framework (SKG-IF)**](https://skg-if.github.io/), this specification refines and extends the current [**SKG-IF Core API specification**](https://skg-if.github.io/api/) to enhance its applicability across a range of research assessment use cases.

The **GraspOS project** has actively contributed to the development of the SKG-IF Core API specification, ensuring it meets real-world interoperability needs in the context of Open Science-aware research assessment.

## Resolver and Search APIs  

GraspOS will support APIs modeled on the guidelines provided in the RA-SKG extension. 
Users are encouraged to refer to the **RA-SKG Documentation** for detailed descriptions of the core entities.  

Τhis API specification defines two main types of APIs:  

* **[Resolver API](/api-spec/resolver-api)** – This follows the approach proposed by the **SKG-IF API specification**, offering a basic resolver mechanism to retrieve single or multiple entities given specific identifiers.  

* **[Search API](/api-spec/search-api)** – A newly introduced API that supports search functionalities for all the core entities defined in the RA-SKG model, allowing more flexible data exploration and retrieval.  

These endpoints will enable seamless interaction with GraspOS services while maintaining compatibility with the broader RA-SKG ecosystem.
