The **GraspOS API specification** is designed to facilitate data exchange and interoperability between onboarded metadata sources and value-added services.  

Built upon the **[RA-SKG extension](https://skg-if.github.io/ext-ra-skg/)** of the [**Scientific Knowledge Graphs Interoperability Framework (SKG-IF)**](https://skg-if.github.io/), this specification refines and extends the current [**SKG-IF Core API specification**](https://skg-if.github.io/api/) to enhance its applicability across a range of research assessment use cases.

The **GraspOS project** has actively contributed to the development of the SKG-IF Core API specification, ensuring it meets real-world interoperability needs in the context of Open Science-aware research assessment.



## API endpoints

This API specification enables users to explore the various entities, facilitating structured metadata retrieval for different types of research-related information.

The API provides endpoints for all core entities of [SKG-IF](https://skg-if.github.io/), as extended by [RA-SKG](https://skg-if.github.io/ext-ra-skg/), offering **two endpoints per entity**:
- One for retrieving [a single record by its unique identifier](/apis/search-api/get-a-single-entity),
- One for [searching multiple records using filters](/apis/search-api/searching-for-entities).

These endpoints will enable seamless interaction with GraspOS services while maintaining compatibility with the broader RA-SKG ecosystem.
