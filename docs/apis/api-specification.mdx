The GraspOS API specification is designed to facilitate data exchange and interoperability between onboarded metadata sources and value-added services. 
Built upon the **RA-SKG extension** of the [Scientific Knowledge Graphs Interoperability Framwork (SKG-IF)](https://skg-if.github.io/), 
this specification refines the current SKG-IF API specification and further extends it to enhance its applicability across a broader range of research assessment use cases.

## Resolver and Search APIs  

GraspOS will support APIs modeled on the guidelines provided in the RA-SKG extension. 
Users are encouraged to refer to the **RA-SKG Documentation** for detailed descriptions of the core entities.  

Τhis API specification defines two main types of APIs:  

* **[Resolver API](./api-spec/resolver-api)** – This follows the approach proposed by the **SKG-IF API specification**, offering a basic resolver mechanism to retrieve single or multiple entities given specific identifiers.  

* **[Search API](./api-spec/search-api)** – A newly introduced API that supports search functionalities for all the core entities defined in the RA-SKG model, allowing more flexible data exploration and retrieval.  

These endpoints will enable seamless interaction with GraspOS services while maintaining compatibility with the broader RA-SKG ecosystem.
